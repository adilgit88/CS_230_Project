## Reflection

1. **What did you set out to accomplish?**  
   I aimed to design a robust, scalable, and secure software architecture to transition "Draw It or Lose It" from an Android app to a web-based, cross-platform solution.

2. **What did you learn from this project?**  
   I deepened my understanding of system architecture, design patterns like Singleton and Iterator, and the importance of platform selection for deployment and development.

3. **What would you do differently next time?**  
   I would start earlier with platform testing to account for browser compatibility issues and invest more time in integrating CI/CD and automated testing strategies.

4. **What does this project demonstrate about you as a software developer?**  
   It demonstrates my ability to analyze technical requirements, apply software design principles, and communicate my ideas through professional documentation.
