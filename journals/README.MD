# Draw It or Lose It â€“ Final Software Design Portfolio

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository contains all journal reflections and the final Software Design Document for the course **CS 230: Software Design and Engineering** at Southern New Hampshire University. The project focuses on redesigning *Draw It or Lose It*â€”originally an Android-exclusive gameâ€”for web, desktop, and mobile platforms using scalable, secure, and distributed architecture principles.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

Redesign **Draw It or Lose It** to:
- Be platform-independent (web, desktop, mobile)
- Support multiple teams and players
- Enforce unique identifiers across entities
- Use a centralized game instance (Singleton pattern)
- Operate in a secure, distributed environment

## ðŸ“„ Software Design Document Summary

### Executive Summary
The Gaming Room seeks to expand its *Draw It or Lose It* game across platforms. This document outlines a modular Java-based software design using design patterns and a Linux server infrastructure to support real-time, scalable, and secure gameplay.

### Requirements
- Unique names for game, team, and player
- Multiple teams and players per game
- Single game instance at a time (Singleton)
- Prevent duplication of entity names

### Design Constraints
- Real-time distributed communication
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Synchronization across all clients
- Security and performance optimization

### Domain Model
- **Entity superclass**: `id`, `name`
- **Game** â†’ List of Teams  
- **Team** â†’ List of Players  
- **Design Patterns**: Singleton (game instance), Iterator (navigation)

### Evaluation
Includes comparison of platform suitability for:
- Server & Client roles
- Development tools
- Compatibility
- Scalability & resource handling

### Recommendations
- **Platform**: Linux (Ubuntu Server LTS)
- **Architecture**: Client-server with microservices (Docker + Kubernetes)
- **Storage**: Cloud-based (Amazon S3, Azure Blob), with local LVM/XFS
- **Memory**: Paging, OOM protection, container memory limits
- **Networking**: REST APIs + WebSockets for real-time features
- **Security**: TLS, AES-256 encryption, OAuth2/JWT, bcrypt, OSSEC

## ðŸ§  Reflection Highlights

- Reinforced understanding of client-server architecture and RESTful API design
- Learned how design patterns like Singleton and Iterator can be used for control and traversal
- Explored distributed architecture strategies using containers and orchestration tools
- Gained insight into securing data through encryption, hashed credentials, and authentication protocols
