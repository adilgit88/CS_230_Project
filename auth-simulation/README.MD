# CS 230 Module Four Journal: Client-Server Architecture Reflection

## 📝 Overview

This repository contains the Module Four journal reflection for **CS 230: Software Design and Engineering** at Southern New Hampshire University. The journal explores the **Client-Server architectural pattern** with a focus on how it supports scalable, secure, and modular development for multi-platform applications like *Draw It or Lose It*.

## 📄 Journal Summary

The reflection discusses how the client-server model enables structured communication between a central server and multiple clients, supporting flexibility across platforms such as web, Android, iOS, and even game consoles. It includes observations on:

- How Dropwizard and RESTful APIs support secure, scalable server-side development.
- How client-side applications interact with the API using standardized protocols.
- Potential enhancements including real-time multiplayer, chat, and notifications.
- Scalability across additional platforms like Xbox and PlayStation using the same backend infrastructure.

## 🔧 Technologies Discussed

- **Dropwizard** – Lightweight Java framework for RESTful APIs
- **RESTful API** – Enables stateless, standardized communication
- **Basic Authentication** – Used for securing API endpoints
- **WebSockets / Long-Polling** – Proposed for real-time features
- **Cross-platform HTTP clients** – Android, iOS, web, and console

## 📈 Future Enhancements Suggested

- Add user registration/login endpoints
- Integrate a relational or NoSQL database (MySQL, MongoDB)
- Enable real-time multiplayer with WebSockets
- Add leaderboards, chat, and push notifications
- Expand to consoles (Xbox, PS4) using platform-native clients

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- The client-server pattern enables independent development and scaling of front-end and back-end components.
- REST APIs promote cross-platform compatibility and modularity.
- Secure authentication and stateless communication are vital for distributed applications.
- Real-time features and future expansions can build upon the current architecture with minimal disruption.
